# CrowdQuake: A Networked System of Low-Cost Sensors for Earthquake Detection via Deep Learning

<!---This is a Python3 implementation of Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for the task of binary classification of seismic detection, as described in our paper.--> 

## Overview

Here we provide the implementation of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) used in our paper in ACM KDD 2020.

The repository is organised as follows:
* ```requirements.txt```: All required Python libraries to run the code.
* ```Code/Processing.py```: Source code for processing the earthquake data.
* ```Code/ANN.py```: Implementation of ANN.
* ```Code/CRNN.py```: Implementation of CRNN.
* ```Code/ANN_kfold.py```: K-fold cross validation for ANN.
* ```Code/CRNN_kfold.py```: K-fold cross validation for CRNN.
* ```Code/PerformanceMetrics.py```: Calculate the Performance Metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset contains two classes of three-component time-series acceleration waveforms:
1. Earthquake: Download from National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED).

> Note: In our paper, we use two earthquake datasets. 
> 1. 2299 K-NET records of Japan earthquakes from Jan. 1st 1996 to May 31th 2019, each of whose x-axis component peak ground acceleration (PGA) is greater than 0.1 gravity (g). 
> 2. 8973 K-NET records of Japan earthquakes from Jan. 1st 1996 to May 31th 2019, each of whose x-axis component PGA is greater than 0.05 g.

> To download the earthquake data for reproducing our results, please: 
>> + Visit [NIED](http://www.kyoshin.bosai.go.jp/kyoshin/data/index_en.html) (registration is required to download data).  
>> + Select `Download` -- `Data Download after Search for Data`.  
>> + Set `Network` -- `K-NET`.  
>> + Set `Peak acceleration` -- `from 100 to 10000` (i.e., > 0.1 g) or `from 50 to 10000` (i.e., > 0.05 g).  
>> + Set `Recording start time`.  
>> + Click `Submit`, then select all records in `Data List`.  
>> + Click `Download All Channels Data`.  
>> + Notice that, due to the constraint of the website, only headmost 1200 data will be displayed in `Data List`. Please change the range of `Recording start time`, then repeat above procedures to download all data in batches.

2. Non-Earthquake: Background noise of the low-cost sensors measured in several environments and various human activities recorded by our low-cost sensors.

You can also use your own dataset, but the dataset should contain three-component time-series acceleration signals.

## Models

You can choose between the following models: 
* ANN: A multi-layer perceptron with three input features (IQR,ZC,and CAV) and a hidden layer of 5 neurons. See more details in our paper or [MyShake](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/2/e1501055) paper.
<!---* CNN--> 
* CRNN: A combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). See more details in our paper.

## Running the code
1. Download the data as described above.
2. Run ```Code/Processing.py``` to process the raw data.
3. Run ```Code/ANN.py``` or ```Codes/CRNN.py``` to train and test each model.
4. Run ```Models/ANN_kfold.py``` or ```Models/CRNN_kfold.py``` for the k-fold cross validation for each model.
5. Run ```Code/PerformanceMetrics.py``` to calculate the performance metrics.
> Note:
> 1. To reproduce our results, please download the same set of data as we used in the paper.  
> 2. For different test cases, please change the settings as described in each code file.
